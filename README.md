# 2048 game on FPGA
## Intro

This VHDL script implements 2048 game on FPGA development board. I design it when conducting EDA course projects. Just for fun! See the photo at the end of the file.

## Required hardwares/softwares

FPGA development board

LCD module (This script is specially designed for FYD12864-0402B)

Altera Quartus II
